0,"Uses QF values provided in the meteorological forcing file (SSss_YYYY_data_tt.txt).
If you do not want to include QF to the calculation of surface energy balance, you should set values in the meteorological forcing file to zero to prevent calculation of QF.
UMEP provides two methods to calculate QF:
(1) LQF which is simpler, (2) GQF which is more complete but requires more data inputs"
1,"|NotRecmd|
QF calculated according to :cite:t:`L11` using coefficients specified in `SUEWS_AnthropogenicEmission.txt`.
Modelled values will be used even if QF is provided in the meteorological forcing file."
2,"|Recmd is only QF is simulated|
QF calculated according to :cite:t:`J11` using coefficients specified in `SUEWS_AnthropogenicEmission.txt` and diurnal patterns specified in `SUEWS_Profiles.txt`.
Modelled values will be used even if QF is provided in the meteorological forcing file."
3,"Updated :cite:t:`L11` method using daily (not instantaneous) air temperature (HDD(id-1,3)) using coefficients specified in `SUEWS_AnthropogenicEmission.txt`."

QF and FC coming from traffic and human metabolism are calculated from transportation and population statistics, 
and from buildings following heating and cooling degree day approach according to J채rvi et al. 2019 (:cite:t:`L19`). 
Parameters specified in SUEWS_AnthropogenicEmission.txt and diurnal patterns specified in SUEWS_Profiles.txt will be used. 
Photosynthesis is simulated using non-rectangular hyberbola equation (:cite:t:`B17`)"
