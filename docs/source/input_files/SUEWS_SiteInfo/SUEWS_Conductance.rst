SUEWS_Conductance.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SUEWS_Conductance.txt contains the parameters needed for the Jarvis
(1976) :cite:`J76` surface conductance model used in the modelling of evaporation in
SUEWS. These values should **not** be changed independently of each
other. The suggested values below have been derived using datasets for
Los Angeles and Vancouver (see :cite:t:`J11`) and should be
used with `gsModel` = 1. An alternative formulation ( `gsModel` = 2 or `gsModel` = 4) uses
slightly different functional forms and different coefficients (with
different units). `gsModel` = 2  uses air temperature from the meteorological forcing in calculating photosynthesis and `gsModel` = 4 the local 2-m air temperature simulated within SUEWS.
